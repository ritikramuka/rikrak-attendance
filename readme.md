Please feel free to download the packaged desktop application [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/187j1OYoeUpJV5F7NVcqwqySMawy4-yLE?usp=sharing).

## So why an attendance app?
So the idea is simple. We have our online classes on Microsoft teams and professors get an option to download all the attendees attendance report which looks like this:

But the issue was that they have to manually mark present absent in their record sheets for each student which was quite a time consuming task

So this is how a simple desktop app where we have to select the downloaded attendance report and the record sheet of students, and on just one click there attendance is marked.

Note: attendance is marked for those students who are in the meeting for more than 45 min.

## Completed and Working features
*Please raise an issue instantly if you find something wrong with these features*
For using this applications these are some things you have to keep in mind:
- attendance report from the teams should be downloaded after the class:
	- As it gives a uniquie key i.e. microsoft teams id.
	- And rules outs the marking of false attendance for students having same name.
- students records should be an excel file where it should have column name "MS Teams ID" with teams id of every student like this:
